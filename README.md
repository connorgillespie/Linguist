## Linguist
Linquist is a simple Unturned workshop translator script written with the popular framework Python. After watching a friend attempt to translate thousands of workshop files by hand, I decided to automate the process and make it public so the world never has to experience this same pain. 

## Instructions
1. Install the necessary requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of ChromeDriver [here](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place in the same directory as the script.
3. Set the path to the workshop mod in the `main.py` file.
4. Run the script! Note that it may take some time to complete since it is manually scraping the web with your Chrome browser. 

## Disclaimer
Please always make a backup before attempting any file automation. I will not be held responsible for any issues caused by the script.
